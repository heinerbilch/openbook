- find how to sync the project.ini file in this branch with the project.ini branch in the master branch.
- the data that this branch (gh-pages) knows about as fast as last commit etc are from this branch.
	the data that it wants to know about is from the master branch (last tag, etc).
	how do I do this?
- do google analytics on my gh-pages project to see how many hits I get and for which resources.
